# Module_11_Challenge

This repository includes both sections of this assignment, along with the exported dataframe of scraped data converted to a CSV file. 

1) Section 1, labeled "part_1_mars_news", consists of a jupyter notebook in which I use the beahtiful soup method to parse out the static Mars News Articles website for the title of each article along with itÂ´s corresponding summary. This data is collected and saved into a python list of dictionaries.
2) Section 2, labeled "part_2_mars_temperature", consists of a jupyter notebook in wich I use the beautiful soup method to scrape a table of Mars Data. This data is stored in a Pandas Dataframe which is used for analysis of said data. The data is then exported into a CSV file.
